The \"canister smart contracts\" on the Internet Computer are expressive enough to build any web application directly on chain and powerful enough to serve these apps at web speed.

The Internet Computer community is redesigning everything from web3 social media dapps, metaverses, and video streaming dapps to powerful games all built end-to-end (front end, backend, asset storage) that are served from the blockchain.
